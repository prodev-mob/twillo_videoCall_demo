# Twilio Video Chat Room Demo Implementation Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for developing a video chat room application powered by Twilio Video and integrated with Flutter. Designed for demo purposes, this project leverages Twilio Functions to dynamically generate access tokens, removing the need for a standalone backend infrastructure. While this is a demonstration project, it showcases essential concepts for building scalable and efficient video communication applications.

## Key Features

- Multi-participant video conferencing with seamless transitions and low latency.
- Real-time toggling of audio states for muting and unmuting participants.
- Dynamic activation and deactivation of video streams for user-controlled visibility.
- Graceful session termination, ensuring optimal resource management.
- Cross-platform compatibility for a consistent and unified user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- An active [Twilio Account](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio) with a verified phone number.
- A properly configured Flutter development environment, including the latest SDKs and tools.
- Familiarity with the Twilio Video SDK and its integration into Flutter applications.
- Basic knowledge of cloud functions and deploying Twilio Functions for token generation.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project repository and navigating to the project directory:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies and ensure proper project setup:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3: Configure Twilio Functions

1. Log in to your Twilio Console and navigate to **Functions** > **Services**.
2. Create a new service and add a Function specifically for generating access tokens.
3. Deploy the Function and copy the generated URL endpoint. This URL will serve as the access token provider for your Flutter application.
```javascript
exports.handler = function(context, event, callback) {
 const AccessToken = Twilio.jwt.AccessToken;
 const twilioAccountSid = "<ACCOUNT_SID>";
 const twilioApiKey = "<TWILIO_API_KEY>";
 const twilioApiSecret = "<TWILIO_API_SECRET>";
 const identity = event.identity;
 const roomName = event.roomName;
 const token = new AccessToken(
   twilioAccountSid,
   twilioApiKey,
   twilioApiSecret,
   {identity: identity}
 );
 
 const videoGrant = new AccessToken.VideoGrant({
   room: roomName
 });

 token.addGrant(videoGrant);
 
 const response = new Twilio.Response();
 const headers = {
   "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
   "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS",
   "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type",
   "Content-Type": "application/json"
 };
      
 response.setHeaders(headers);
 response.setBody({
   accessToken: token.toJwt()
 });

 return callback(null, response);
};
```

### Step 4: Launch the Application

Run the Flutter application on your preferred testing environment (physical device or emulator) using the command below:

```bash
flutter run
```

## User Workflow

Follow these steps to use the demo application:

1. Launch the app on a physical device or emulator.
2. Enter a specific room name or use the default room name pre-configured in the app.
3. Tap the **Enter the Room** button to connect to the video chat room in real time.
4. During the session:
    - Use the audio toggle to mute or unmute yourself.
    - Control your visibility by activating or deactivating your video stream.
    - Exit the room gracefully using the designated exit option to free up resources.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are integral to the applicationâ€™s functionality:

- [twilio\_programmable\_video](https://pub.dev/packages/twilio_programmable_video): Integrates Twilio Video APIs for video conferencing capabilities.
